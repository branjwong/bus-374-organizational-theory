Reading Notes
-------------

- Production begins

    - when individual capital employs large number of labourers
    - When labour process is carried on an extensive scale
    - When yield gives large quantities of products

- Output variance is scarier the smaller the collectives are

    - If you have a small team, you could

        - have people whose performance greatly exceeds the average
        - Have people whose performance greatly superceeds the average
        - And those people would creatly skew your team’s output

    - A larger organization isn’t as scared of this kind of variance, and the more people there are, the more there output is guaranteed to look like what is the average

- For larger collectives, there are significant gains to be made over smaller collectives

    - a portion of the means of production are able to be shared amongst the individuals that work
        
        - e.g. a room where twenty weavers work at twenty looms must be larger than the room of a single weaver with two assistants, but it costs less labour to build one workshop for twenty persons than to build ten to accomoodate two weavers each

- People working together produce more than people working individually -- because humans are social animals
- Masons passing stones -> sounds like our paper passing game

- Cooperation allows for doing things that no individual could do on their own

    - Get an amount done within a short time frame (i.e. working faster)

    - Doing things that require more people (e.g. draining, constructing dykes, making canals, roads, railways)

- Generally, labourers cannot co-operate without being brought together
- A minimum amount of capital is necessary to move up in status (from labourer, to small master, to capitalist)

- Combined labour on a large scale requires a directing authority in order

    - To secure the harmonious working of the individual activities and
    - To perform the general functions that have their origin in the combination of work done
        
        - e.g. an orchestra requires a conductor

- End aim of capitalist production is to extra the greatest possible amount of surplus value, and to exploit labour-power to the greatest possible extent
