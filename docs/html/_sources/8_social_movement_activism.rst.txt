Pre-amble
---------

- uses a theory of social movement outcomes to explain why certain corporates targeted by boycotts are more likely to concede to boycotters' demands
- predicts that 
    
    - boycotts threatn tangible and intangible resources held by corporate targets
    - these threats are transmitted indirectly through media coverage of the boycotts
    - past declines in sales or reputation create opportunities for a movement to have influence
    - the level of threat posed by a boycott generates more influence when targeted against corporations that recently have experienced declines in sales or reputation

Introduction
------------

- scholars are intrested in how social movements convince organizational leaders to make changes to their policies or practices
- when are social movement activists -- a relatively powerless community of individuals -- able to influence managers to change?
- corporate governance scholars assert that managers will not or should not alter policies unless the change favors shareholders
- organizational sociologists have argued that in the current era of "investory caplitalism",shareholders' interests have primacy over other decision-making criteria

- themes of this literature

    - social movements can help change political and organizational agendas by using extra-institutional tactics 
    
        - (tactics that are not embraced by institutional elites and are in someway subversive to the target institution)

        - extra-institutional tactics draw attention to perceived injusticies and broaden political discussion to include voices not typically represented in legitmate channels of change

            - e.g. protest, an extra-institutional tactic that highlights the outsider role of activists and appeals to third parties by broadcastings grievances publicly

    - exogenous factors (political opportunities) predispose certain movements' targets to change

    - (the political mediation model proposes that) movements are more influential in some contexts than others

- boycotting is an extra-institutional tactic that is used to gain influence over corporations 

    - often used when activists lack other means of influence
    - have been proven to be a reliable tactic to initiate organizational and social change
    - evidence suggetsts that boycotts vary in effectiveness
    
        - empircal examination found that only a quarter of all publicized boycotts were successful
        - effects on stock price had mixed results
        - some boycotts actually led to positive effects on stock price

- boycotts usually focuses on its ability to divert revenue from the corporate target
- threatening the company's public image is another possible focus


Explaining Corporate Concessions to Boycotters
----------------------------------------------

- by refusing to buy a company's services or products, consumers express their dissatisfaction with the target and make political claims about corporate practices
- boycotts are deemed successful when the demands of the boycotters are met by the corporate target

    - the corporation makes an explicit and public effort to address the concerns of the boycotters, causing an end to the boycott
    - e.g. Toyota pulled off the air a television ad with a gold Toyota insignia after the Rainbow Coalition, a civil rights orgnization org accused them of reinforcing racial stereotypes

        - they also increased its miniority-spending budget by 35%

The Threat of Extra-institutional Tactics
`````````````````````````````````````````

- extra-institutional tactics threaten targets by:

    - distrupting organizational routines and imposing costs

        - threaten to constrain the target organization from obtaining critical resources
        - constrain revenue and impose marketing costs
        - believed to be successful insofar as they take potential revenue away from the firm

    
    - appealing to broader organizational audiences

        - relies on the boycott's potential to shape public perception of the firm, regardless of potential financial losses
        - tactics publicly broadcast a movenent's grievances and appeal to the sensibilities of the target organization's primary audiences (e.g. customers)
        - protests indirectly influence legislators by shaping public opinion on a specific issue and by changing the calculus of voters
        - when a firm's reputation partly rests on its demonstration of social responsibility, trustworthiness, and conformity to industry and societal norms, the firm is vulnerable to reputation-based attacks from activists and secondary stakeholders
        - sociologists have argued that social movements used media or journalistic accounts to challenge culturally dominant images, such as those offered by corporations
        - *corporate targets are more likely to concede to boycotts that generate high levels of media attention*

Movement Opportunities for Change
`````````````````````````````````

- certain charactistics of a movement's target may predispose it to influence by corporate outsiders and create movement opportunities for change
- the same factors tha tmake an organization an attractive target for movement activists are the same factors that make an organization suscuptible to change
    
    - the determinant success may not be the effect of particular tactics, rather activism merely initiates a conversation among managers who are already predisposed to make changes

- environmental feedback as a source for change
    
    - negative feedback encourages managers to reevaluate current policies and consider implementing alternatives
    
        - managers who receive negative feedback may feel that they have more freedom to pursue new policies and practicies
    
    - declines in performance spur change by encouraging managers to remain open to new input

    - *corporate targets are more likely to concede to boycotts when they have experienced a decline in sales revenue*
    - *corporate targets are more likely to concede to boycotts when they have experienced a decline in reputation*

The Political Mediation Model of Influence
``````````````````````````````````````````

- Political Mediation Model: 

    > a movement's influence on policymaking depends on the combination of a movement's mobiliation and its opportunities

- a movement's attempts to initiate change in extremely closed settings have an attenuated (i.e. small) effect on decision making, but as the contexts becomes more malleable and supportive of change, the movement's threat is magnified

- a movement's threat may accentuate the immediacy and the visibility of negative feedback
- the negative feedback created by performance declines may sensitize managers to the concerns of stakeholders, and to the grievances of boycotters

- *media attention to a boycott will have a stronger effect on the likelihood of corporate concessions when the corporation target has experienced a decline in sales*
- *media attention to a boycott will have a stronger effect on the likelihood of corporate concessions when the corporate target has eperienced a decline in reputation*
