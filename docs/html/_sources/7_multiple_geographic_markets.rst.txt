- Focuses on growth in current markets and entry into new markets 

- Competition

    - Across multiple geographic markets (important determinant of organizational interaction) 

- Multimarket contact and competition 

    - How organizations deal with repeated contact with rivals over time and across social and physical space 

    - .. important:: Cooperation among rivals increases when rivals interact in multiple domains 

        - Fear of reciprocal harm – competing in every market you meet in – therefore competitors refrain from using their strongest weapons against each other 

    - Multimarket firms will not take aggressive action against competitors in one market if they fear retaliation from those competitors in other markets ( as long as the competitor does not compete as well) 

    - Multipoint rivals act less aggressively towards multipoint rivals than single point rivals 

        - Joint involvement in multiple markets creates a network of indirect ties between multimarket firms 

        - Potential substitutes so motivate to limit competition 

    - They will compete more aggressively against organizations that they meet in few markets and they therefore view as weak competitors 

        - If firms meet in multiple markets, they can anticipate each other’s future competitive behaviour and their ability to harm each other

- Limits of mutual forbearance 

    - Assumes the decision markers take into account the effects of actions in individual markers on the firms 

- Single market firms seek to embed themselves in interfirm networks with high levels of multipoint contact 

    - Mutual forbearance between firms are high and single market firms can take advantage
