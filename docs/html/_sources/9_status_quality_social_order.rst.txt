Pre-amble
---------

- examines how a producer's status in the market influences its choices about product quality, and the outcomes that result

- compares

    - economic models of reputation that emphasize the role of past quality as a source of information about current quality 

        with 
    
    - sociological models of status that emphasize the role of affiliations

- results show that actors occupying high-status positions obtain greater benefit from subsequent high-status affiliations than do actors occupying low-status positions

    - thus, these actors are more willing and able to pay for subsequent high-status affiliations and to use them to advance their position in the larger status ordering


Introduction
------------

- market ties are conduits for flows of information and resources

    - market ties represent channels for the transmission of goods and services valued by market actors

- market ties are also important conveyers of identity in that an actor's relations in a market influence how others perceive the actor

    - market exchange is viewed (in part) as an act of affiliation whereby the average status of a market actor's affiliates influences perceptions of the actor and thus the flow of payments, resources, and opportunities available to that actor

- paper seeks to 

    - show that an actor's status position influences the quality at which the actor chooses to produce as well as the economic returns the actor derives from producing at a given quality

        - examine how the affillations constituting an actor's status position actually affect the actor's choice in quality and its subsequent returns

    - show how previous research into status dynamics in both market and nonmarket settings has poorly related quality to status
    
        - exmaine status relations in the California wine industry, as its context allows to include more direct measures of past and present quality because of the substantial amount of time and attention the industry devotes to measuring quality differences accross products

    - clarify a mechanism for understanding the reproduction of the status ordering by demonstrating how an actor's current affiliations affect and constrain returns to subsequent affiliations
    
Affillation, Status, and Quality
--------------------------------

- a consumer's expectations about the quality of a prodcuer's products determine (in part) the follow of payments and resources that a producer receives
- question: what determines such expectations in the first place?

    - the quality of past offerings
    - reputation
    - identification through affiliation with other market actors
    
        - when a firm enters into an ongoing relationship with an auditor, the auditor's status affeects how others perceive the firm

            - e.g. when a hospital establishes and publicizes relations with a rell-respected agency or donor group, it increases the perceived quality of its services

            - e.g. when a young firm affiliates with a more estbalished community group or other well-known organization it may increase the perceived legitmacy of its activities and thus its chances of survival

- the status of one's affilations should increase returns to an actor's past demonstrations of quality int he market
- returns to quality in the market should decrease to the extent that the market actor does not affiliate with high-status others

    - status distinctions across actors may act as a screen or filter, drawing attention away from market actors with lower-status affillates and towards actors with higher-status affilliates

        - it is easier to observe affillations than it is to observe differences in quality

            - e.g. when evaluating job applications, its often easier to observe educational afffilations and the status of an applicant's references than it is to immediately observe differences in individual performance
            - e.g. in investment banking industry, it is easier to observe the status of a bank's exchange partners than it is to discern differences in bank quality
            - e.g. in selecting a daycare facility, it may be easier to observe a facilty's affilations with other parents or community groups than it is to observe the quality of daily care

    - if the likelyhood of observing a market actor's investment in quality increases with the status of the actor's affiliates, then those with lower-status affiliations will generally find it more difficult to recoup a given investment in quality

- the status of an actor's affiliates can also bias evaluations of quality

    - perceptions are largely influenced by the context in which they are embedded
    - social structures and patterns of relation 
    
        - direct atttention, 
        - dictate the information on which we focus, and 
        - shape the meanings, attributions, and emotional responses that such information elicts

    - arguments attributed to high-status actors produce greater attitude change than arguments attributed to low-status actors
    - messages associated with high-status sources are: 
    
        - attended to more closely
        - recalled more successfully,
        - regarded as more accurate and reliable, and
        - deemed more qorthy of adoption

        than when these same messages are associated with low-status sources

    - claims of quality (either implicit or explit) made by firms with high-status affiliations are more likely to be considered credible and trustworthy than similiar claims made with low-status affillations
    - **status distinctions may engender past and present beliefs about quality**, which potential market participants not only use and are slow to revise by for which they are also willing to pay a premium

- if an actor's affililations affects returns to an actor's investment in quality, than the status of an actor's affillations may also influence the quality level at which that actor **chooses to produce**
    
    - if high-status affilations increase returns to past demonstrations of quality, then low-status affillations will likely decrease returns and thus reduce the willingness of actors possessing them to produce high-quality products
    - if market actors with low-status affillations bid for inputs that are necessary to produce high-quality goods, it is likely these actors will be outbid by their competitors with higher-status affiliations, since this latter group will be able to command higher prices for the goods that follow
    - low status actors may face greater barriers and have less incentive to pay the costs as associated with producing high-quality products, whereas high status actors will have fewer barriers and thus greater incentive to produce hihger quality

.. admonition:: Hypothesis 1

    the status of an actor's affilliates will have a positive effect on the actor's reqards in the market

.. admonition:: Hypothesis 2

    the status of an actor's affiliates will increase returns to past demonstrations of quality

.. admonition:: Hypothesis 3

    the higher the status of an actor's affiliates, the more likely that the actor will subsequently choose to produce high-quality products

- question: what prevents all actors from developing high-status affiliations, and, in the process, diluting the status signal?

    - high-status firms have a vested interest in avoiding relations with low-status, low-quality producers becasue such relations treaten their own status
    
        - firms with well-established high-status relations are likely to have more affiliative options from which to choose and thus are more likely to associate with others of similar status to preserve their relative advantage
        - this makes it more difficult or costly for low-status firms to affilate with high-status firms

    - the behavior of low-status firms is less likely to be noted or observed than the behavior of high-status firms

        - if there is a cost associated with affiliation, and if the actions of low-status firms are less likely to be noted, then low-status firms will obtain lower returns and be less likely to investment

.. admonition:: Hypothesis 4

    the higher (or lower) an actor's status, the greater (or less) the net benefit the actor will derive from subsequent high-status affiliation

    - returns to high-status affiliation will be lower for actors that have not established high-status affilliations in the past
