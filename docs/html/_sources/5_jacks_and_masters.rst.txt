- The assumption “principal of allocation”: the greater the diversity in regions of resource space targeted by an organization, the lower the organizations capacity to perform well within them

- Trade-off between organization’s niche width and its capacity for performance (audience appeal)

    - Could become jack of all trades and appeal to none or concentrate on developing one or a few capacities (generalists vs specialists)

- Power of the audience in shaping organizational opportunities and constraints

    - Organizations must demonstrate conformity with audience expectations

- Study conducted on US film industry – target broad niche or specific one

    - Niche = the set of all point along such dimensions for which the organization is potentially able to garner the resources necessary for survival

    - Width of niche = level of variance in environmental resources within the region bounded by these points

        - Generalists – wide width (outcompete when given unpredictable environment)
        - Specialists – narrow width (one type of action performed efficiently and reliably  will out compete generalists if competing for the same thing)

    - Audiences occupy different taste positions in an organizations resource space
        - An increase in niche width must decrease the level of an organization’s engagement across its diverse positions

    - Examined reactions of films from two audiences: professional critics and general consumers

- Films that target broader niches generally attract a larger proportion of the audience (both professional and consumers) BUT they generate less appeal among those audience members

    - Audiences have difficulty interpreting broad producers and cause poor fit with their expectations and preferred tastes

- **Audience members perceptions play in niche-based dynamics**
