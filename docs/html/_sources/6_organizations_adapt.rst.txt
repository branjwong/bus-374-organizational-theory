How Do Organizations Adapt?
===========================

`Kozhikode, R. K. 2016. Dormancy as a Strategic Response to Detrimental Public Policy. Organization Science, In press. <https://pubsonline-informs-org.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.2015.1027>`_

- Dormancy entails a temporary reduction in an organizations level of activity
    
    - Dormancy is rewarded when the favourable policy return (negative policy gone)

- Threat of the policy soon being rewritten or gone is a precondition for dormancy to be the response to bad public policy – “short lived policy” due to policy makers being replaced in the next election
    
    - Policies that require organizations to undergo undesirable adaptations – from the perspective of an important stakeholder
    
    - Detrimental yet potentially reversible public policies  temporarily reduce level of activity while detrimental policy is in place:
    
        - reduced negative effects of the policy and helps organization remain legitimate which is essential to the survival of a firm

- Studied commercial banks in india that were subject to detrimental change in 1980 that was reversed in 1991
   
    - Banks only operated in lucrative urban centers and not in rural areas causing the government to try to force them to enter rural areas ( 4 new branches in rural areas for every 1 new branch opened in urban areas)

        - The rule was lifted as a loan from the IMF stipulated the Indian economy must be liberalized
        
- Three responses typically taken for organizations are exit, voice or loyalty  none of which account for public policy that will be reversed
   
    - Exit – not feasible if large suck costs, or not permitted by government

        - Loss of legitimacy if organization tried to enter again

    - Voice – costly or illegal in some countries

        - Loyalty – requires replacing successful organizational routines

- Organizational dormancy
   
    - Organizations reduce activity to buffer against detrimental public policy and become active again when the policy is reversed

        - Avoid damaged caused by full compliance

                - Assumes policy is subject to reversal
        
- Scope conditions
   
    - Theory does not apply when a regulation bans organization’s core activities ( can restrict but cannot outright ban)
    
    - Availability of political opportunity – policy can be reversed

        - Independence from the state – excessive dependency on the state reduces managerial discretion (increase loyalty to policy)
    
- Organizations the chose to remain dormant while the detrimental public policy lasted would retain their core capabilities and allow them to perform well when a favorable policy resume
- Results – older banks more likely to enter dormancy could be due to experience
- Timely information about political change is important to adopt a dormancy response
