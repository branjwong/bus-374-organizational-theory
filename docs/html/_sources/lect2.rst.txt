Why are there so many different types of organizations?
=======================================================

- "managers were thought of as all capable individual"
- different species of organizations
- survival of the fittest

    - by fit, we mean suiting the current set of needs, given infrastructure
    - not best

- punishment for deviance: you are not this thing if you deviate in this way

    - that's how you know this thing is in fact this thing
