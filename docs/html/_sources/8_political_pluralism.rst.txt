- When competing parties control the state and national governments it promotes business expansion 

- When government power if fragmented, actors in each fragment can influence or exert authority over public policy 

- Political pluralism makes it more difficult to gain prereferral treatment 

- The impact of political pluralism 

    - Checks and balances – avoid concentration of power in few hands 

    - Organizations enjoy greater discretion in their decisions 

    - Political pluralism can limit government intervention in business affairs and encourage businesses to expand 

    - Effect of political pluralism is weaker when there is little competition between political parties – safe states 

    - Differences in corporate opportunities for state owned firms and private firms

        - State owned/dependant hesitate to open in pluralistic environments 

    - Organizations know more about locations they are already in and are able to expand as they know the risks involved 

- Results

    - Political pluralism results in less government interference & organizations enjoy greater latitude of action 

    - Benefits between political pluralism and business expansion can be weakened if there if a reduction in political competition ( safe state not a swing state)
