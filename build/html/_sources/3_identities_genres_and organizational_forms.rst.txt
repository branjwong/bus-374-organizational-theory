Introduction
------------

- question: how is an organization defined?

    - e.g. identity as the fundamental basis for the conceptualization and identification of organizational forms

- paper highlights benefits of identity-based answer 

Population-Based Research
-------------------------

- organizational ecology

    - examines the full histories of populations because early events can have lasting consequences for population dynamics
    - gathers life history data on all organizations in the population(s) (famous and insignificant) to avoid problems of selectivity bias
    - records detailed information about type of entry (e.g. new founding, entry from another industry, merger) and exit (dispanding, acquisition, etc)
    - usese event-history methods to estimate the effects of characteristics of an organization, population, and evironment on the hazards of entry and exit

- getting the population boundaries (e.g. individual, organization, industry) is hard

- some forms do not fit any conventional notion of industry

    - e.g. social movement organizations
    - e.g. worker cooperatives

- the value of population research depends heavily on whether the populations studied represent instances of meaningful social units, but there's little agreement on how to define forms

Conceptualizing Organizational Identity
---------------------------------------

- organizational identity consists of social codes (or set of rules) that specify the features an organization is expected to possess
- codes represent default expectations held by audiences about organizational properties and the constraints held by those properties
- satisfaction or violation of codes affect the direction and strength of an audience's social approval of an organization
- audiences impose constraints on the values organizations adopt through the threat of devaluation

- locus of identity

    - identity inheres in the expectations, assumptions, and beliefs held by agents, both internal and external to an organization
    - organizations generally face multiple audiences that can hold different, perhaps conflicting, defaults for an organozation
    
        - e.g. differences between top-managers and entry-level workers
        - e.g. differences across classes of outsiders: government regulartors, critics, industry analysists, consumers and clients

        - **institutional consolidation** (IC) of identity, the complete agreement among different audiences about the codes and expectations for identity
            
            - low IC: conflicting demands on organizations

                - confusion and ambiguity for organizational decision makers
                - hampers an organization's ability to negotiate its external environment
                - often, the difficulty of managing a multiplicity of different identity outweighs the potential advantages
                - potential advantage: enabiling one to maintain a relatively wide array of options across unforeseeable futures to avoid entanglement

            - high IC: all audiences hold the same expectations and enforce the same codes
                
                - violations of standards are met with sharp devaluations
                - presumably generates greater adherence to and persistence of codes

- perceived satisfaction or violation of identity codes has important and observable consequences for organizations

- conception of identity differs from the common perspective of literature on organizational behaviour

    - treats organizaitonal identity as solely determined by the organization's members
    - research on identity that limits its focus to organizational insiders cannot determine the relative importance of internal vs. external constraints

Organizational Forms
--------------------

- organizational forms represent a special kind of collective organizational identity
- the concept of a form involves an abstraction from the uniqueness of individual organizations nad a typification of commonality
    
    - e.g. individual organizations come to resemble one another (through immitation or selection) and audiences recognize and code the resemblances into a form
    - e.g. state authorities specify a code for a new kind of organization, authorize it, and create incentives that benefit those actors who adopt the authorizated design

- suppose that before there is an organizational form, there is an audience's **codified category**, which acts a placeholder for the cultural object that can potential become a form

    - represented as an ordered pair:
    
        (<an audience's label>, [ <its codes> ])

- membership in a category is conferred by an audience, not chosen by focal organizations

    - firststep: audience screens candidate organizations
    - secondstep: audience inspects properties of validated form members and makes further quality distinctions

- organizations that fail to establish themselves clearly as a member of a legitimated form in the eyes of important evaluators suffer from lowered valuation
- form valuation does **not** imply that a validated member actually conforms to codes specifying the form

- a category achieves the status of a form through legitimation in the eyes of relevant audiences 

    - naming is an important step in the legitimation process, as audiences find it easier to isolate a particular phenomonon from the rest of the world when they have a label for it
