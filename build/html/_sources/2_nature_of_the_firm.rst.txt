Reading Notes
-------------

- theory of economic system by Sir Arthur Salter

    - **economic system**

        - no central control for it's operation
        - a process that is automatic, elastic, and responsive

            - adjusts supply to demand
            - adjusts production to consumption

        - coordinated by the price mechanism
        - society becomes an organism (not an organization)
        - "works itself"

    - assumes that the direction of resources is dependent directly on the price mechanism

    - gives incomplete picture of our economic system

        - e.g. "allocation of factors of production between different uses is determine by price"

            - counter example: workman moves from department Y to X because he is ordered to do so, **not because of a change in relative price**


- Coase's theory of a Firm

    - **firm**

        - the distinguishing mark of the firm is the supersession of the price mechanism
        - related to an outside network of relative prices and costs
        -

- conflicting theories of price

    - price as a coordinating instrument
    - price as a coordinating function of the entrepreneur
