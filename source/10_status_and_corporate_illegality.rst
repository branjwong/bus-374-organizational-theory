Pre-amble
---------

- why might (status secure) high-status organizations resort to illegality?
- considers possibility of the overstatement of the estimated relative security of high-status organizations in status theory

Introduction
------------

- high-status organizations enjoy a sense of security resulting from the stability of the status order

    - should limit their need to engage in questionable activities
    - **status homophily**, implies that high-status organizations carefully associate only with others of high status and cautiously avoid associations with low-status organizations

- high-status organizations **do** engage in illegality and suffer the penalties of doing so, despite this
- question: why?

- high-status organizations might actually be **insecure** in their status

    - .. important:: firms may engage in corporate illegality to avoid the loss they might incur if they were to fail to meet the unrealistic performance expectations of their audience

    - the link between good performance and illegality is stronger for prominent firms
    - **prominent firms**, a firm with a high degree to which external audiences are aware of its existence, as well as the extent to which they view it as relevant and salient
    - loss aversion by high-status firms may be triggered by a fear of status loss should it fail to meet its associates' expectations about vital attributes of its reputation
    - **status loss**, a decline in the deference formerly enjoyed by an organization among its associates, whereby its associates no longer prioritize the organization as a preferred partner

- considerations linking the insecurity of high-status organizations with their motivation to engage in illegality
    
    - reputation for quality as a source of insecurity
    - why illegality might be adopted to deal with insecurity
    - when legality is less likely to be chosen

- an organization's reputation can vary in terms of its attributes

    - e.g. a positive reputation in terms of product quality and financial asset quality, but a negative reputation in terms of integrity

    - high-status clients use status cues to screen service providers and that clients subsequently tend to associate primarily with providers within their status class whose reputations meet their expectation **in terms of specific attributes that they care about**

    - high-status organizations may be willing to take risks with one aspect of their reputation to compensate for the ones that are most commensurate with a high-status position

    - quality is often associated with status
        
        - potential associates infer quality from an organization's relationships with high-status others, which are often more readily observable than its own underlying quality

        - internal associates are in a better position to evaluate the underlying quality of high-status organizations owning, since they interact closely with them

            - creates pressure on high-status organizations to continuously improve upon its own reputation for quality and to exceed/keep up with the reputations for quality of other high-status organizations if it is to maintain its own high-status position

            - high status firms may then be more willing to resort to illegal acts to enhance/maintain its reputation for quality

            - the organization may reason that it will be able to divert attention away from any illegal acts, because it used them only as a means of meeting expectations of *reputation for quality*

                - discovery may contibute to status loss

            - the tendency for illegality will be mitigated when the associates of a high-status organization also care about the *reputation for integrity*

- this study does the following

    - emphasizes the need to reconsider conventional assumption that high-status organizations enjoy relative security

        - shows the fear of potential status loss can prompt high-status organizations to resort to corporate illegality

    - considers the link between reputation for quality and status to be indirect, and considers this link to be less relevant for status once the organization establishes its position higher up in the status hierarchy

    - shows that reputation for other attributes may also affect partner choice decisions

    - draws attention to the burdens of occupying a highi-status position and its deterimental effect on organizational actions

.. admonition:: Hypothesis 1

    The higher an organizations, status, the more likely it is to engage in corporate illegality.

.. admonition:: Hypothesis 2

    Any positive association between an organization's status and its level of illegal activity will be stronger when the organization falls short of its historical reputation for quality.

.. admonition:: Hypothesis 3

    Any positive association between an organization's status and its level of illegal activity will be stronger whne the organization's reputation for quality falls short of those of its peers.

.. admonition:: Hypotheis 4

    Any positive association between an organization's status and its level of illegal activity will be weaker when the organization's associates are rated higher in terms of reputation for integrity.
