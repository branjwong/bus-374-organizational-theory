Introduction
------------

- question: how can we predict the outcome of competitive interactions among organizations?

- organizations, in their efforts to develop competitive strategies, are constrained by past organizational practices

- objective: develop and test an evolutionary model to answer the question

- "Red Queen" evolutionary theory

    - organizations facing competition are likely to respond, but it's response is likely to be limited
    - response then marginally increases the competition faced by the organization's rivals, triggering in them a similar process of search and decision -- increasing competition for first org, ...
 
- claim: an organization's fitness is best understood as relative tothat of other organizations
- claim: the success and failure of entire industries can be traced to whether they have endured competition

An Ecology of Learning Organizations
------------------------------------

- strategies emerge more often through incremental adjustments rather than a comprehensive strategic plan

    - e.g. policy changes by top-level management, changes initiated at low levels

- organizational routines that perform satisfactorily are left alone, so no searches for improvements are triggered even if better practices could be found

- when performance falls below an acceptable range, members of the organization notice and then search for possible solutions

    - search continues until a satisfactory solution is found and (likely) adopted by the organization

- search and learning are costly, e.g.:

    - implementing new products, product attributes services, and routines

- sometimes learning is adaptive, i.e. it's made suitable for use, and is so when its results are sufficiently beneficial to offset costs of search+learning
- assumption: organizational learning is adaptive on average
- sometimes org learning is maladaptive

    - searches not fruitful
    - adjustments are ineffective
    - changes incur costs that outweigh benefits

The Red Queen as an Adapative Process
-------------------------------------

- when two companies compete, and in doing so search and learn in order to do better, the evolution in one company causes the performance of the other to stifle, and so it in turn searches and learns
- because Red Queen dynamic is self-reinforcing, it isp robably an important stimulus to strategic evolution
- if the Red Queen is adaptive, organizations with more experienced rivals will be less viable, as experienced rivals generate stronger competition

Evolutionary Constraints and the Maladaptive Red Queen
------------------------------------------------------

- each organization is constrained by its history
- organizations are constrained by lessons learned in the past

    - **competence trap**, where organizations respond to new developments using routines that were learned under a previous regime, harming their performance by doing only what worked well under different circumstances

        - trap may be deepened by a mutual reinforcement in an ecology of organizational learning
            
            - e.g. established firms have been known to collectively deny the possibility that new practices and technologies are changing the basis of competition in an industry, preferring to stay with well-learned by outdated practices
            
            - as time passes and circumstances changed, what was learned in a Red Queen during the previously era may end up harming organizations the organizations it helped previously
