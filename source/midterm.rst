**From an identity-based view, are these organizations of the same organiztional form or does each represent distinct organizational forms, or can they be pooled into different sub-categories of organizational forms? Substantiate your answer by relating the quotations provided to the notions identity, conformity and deviance**.


- the concept of a form involves an abstraction from the uniqueness of individual organizations and a typification of commonality

    - translation: individual organizations may have individual differences, but the similiarity of some organizations can still be abstracted away into a unifying label
    - e.g. individual organizations come to resemble one another (through immitation or selection) and audiences recognize and code the resemblances into a form

        - Facebook and Twitter are online social networking platforms

            - fb: "power to share and make the world more open and connected"
            - twit: "connects businesses to customers... businesses use Twitter to [...] build relationships with customers... offers businesses an easy way to reach an engaged audience"
            - it's known that they're online

        - Amazon, Chapters are retailers

            - Amazon: "customers can find anything they want to buy online... "
            - Chapters: "to provide customers with retail environment for books"

        - Amaozn and Ebay are online marketplaces

            - Amazon: "customers can find anything they want to buy online... ", it's known that Amazon sells things offered by other retailers
            - Ebay: "communities built on commerce"
            - it's known that they're online


- a category achieves the status of a form through legitimation in the eyes of relevant audiences 

    - naming is an important step in the legitimation process, as audiences find it easier to isolate a particular phenomonon from the rest of the world when they have a label for it


- assumption: an organization can only be recognized as related to **one** organizational form




- locus of identiy: how audiences percieve them

    - identity inheres in the expectations, assumptions, and beliefs held by agents, both internal and external to an organization
    - organizations generally face multiple audiences that can hold different, perhaps conflicting, defaults for an organozation
    - violations of identity codes screw orgs

- the concept of a form involves an abstraction from the uniqueness of individual organizations and a typification of commonality
    
    - e.g. individual organizations come to resemble one another (through immitation or selection) and audiences recognize and code the resemblances into a form
    - e.g. state authorities specify a code for a new kind of organization, authorize it, and create incentives that benefit those actors who adopt the authorizated design

**What do you understand by generalists and specialists?** 

- the classification of generalist and specialist describes an organizations strategy of performing within many or few resource spaces

    - the generalist widens its niche

        - it strives to become the jack of all trades and perform decently in many capacities
        - will survive when given an unpredictable environment

    - the specialist narrows its niche

        - it tries to perform excellently in fewer (or a singular) regions
        - will outcompete generalists if competiting for the same thing
        - is hurt by unpredictability

** Classify the above listed organizations as generalists or specialists and offere logical explanations to your classification choices for each.**


Specialists:

    - Chapters: books
    - Ebay: they aren't a retailer themselves
    - Facebook: isn't very business centric, more about the individuals within their social network and their ability to advertise to them

Generalists:

    - Amazon: both provide a marketplace and operate within it (sell their own products)
    - Twitter: community, advertisement, business, sales... lots going on


- The assumption “principal of allocation”: the greater the diversity in regions of resource space targeted by an organization, the lower the organizations capacity to perform well within them

- Trade-off between organization’s niche width and its capacity for performance (audience appeal)

    - Could become jack of all trades and appeal to none or concentrate on developing one or a few capacities (generalists vs specialists)

- Power of the audience in shaping organizational opportunities and constraints

    - Organizations must demonstrate conformity with audience expectations

- Study conducted on US film industry – target broad niche or specific one

    - Niche = the set of all point along such dimensions for which the organization is potentially able to garner the resources necessary for survival

    - Width of niche = level of variance in environmental resources within the region bounded by these points

        - Generalists – wide width (outcompete when given unpredictable environment)
        - Specialists – narrow width (one type of action performed efficiently and reliably  will out compete generalists if competing for the same thing)

    - Audiences occupy different taste positions in an organizations resource space
        - An increase in niche width must decrease the level of an organization’s engagement across its diverse positions

    - Examined reactions of films from two audiences: professional critics and general consumers

- Films that target broader niches generally attract a larger proportion of the audience (both professional and consumers) BUT they generate less appeal among those audience members

    - Audiences have difficulty interpreting broad producers and cause poor fit with their expectations and preferred tastes


Question 4
----------

Theory suggests that engaging the audience of a certain niche is important if an organization is to cater to that niche, but Titanic did engage the documentary niche by being factually accurate and promoting the documentary elements of the film in the trailers, yet...


filmgoers and critics widely consider Titanic an "epic, romantic, disaster" film and not as a "documentary." Why do you think that this is the case?


- when we say that Titanic is widely considered **x**, we are saying that more people consider it **x** than any other **y**, even it is true that many elements of Titanic reflect it's relation to niche **y**
        
    - population size argument

        - more people who watch films watch "epic, romantic, disaster" films than they do "documentary" films.
        - since Titanic is designed occupy at least these two niches, and in turn engage people who are predisposed to both of these niches, then the niche that is represented by a significantly larger population will be perceived by more people as a more significant part of that movie's identity

    - marketing strategy argument
        
        - a viewers first interaction with a movie is often through its marketing material
        - it's through the context of marketing material that a viewers perception of a made
        - it is likely that the marketing material of Titanic highlighted the "epic, romantic, and disaster" parts of the film over it's "documentary" parts, in order to appeal to the masses

- (people are more predisposed to watching the types of movies they already frequently watch and enjoy)


What would have been the consequence of promoting the film purely as a documentary?

- if this film was promoted as only a documentary, then only those predisposed to documentary films would have gone out to see this film
    
    - this would have meant lower sales

- those who expected a documentary would likely be displeased with what they saw as the "epic, romantic, disaster" parts of the film would betray their expectation of a "documentary" film
    
    - this would affect it's reception by filmgoers, critics, and hurt sales even more
    - probably wouldn't have gotten the Oscar nominations/wins it got either





Question 5
----------

According to transaction cost economics, firm are alternatives to the market for organizing economic transactions. Explain how firms deal with transaction costs when transactions are carried out inside the boundaries of the firm instead of in the market. Offer suitable examples.


wtf are transaction costs

    - cost of organizing a transaction? e.g. contracts
    - risk?


Question 6
----------


What is structural inertia? How does it affect diversity in organizational populations?

- when deviance from institutional expectations by organizations is known to be punishing

    - happens when organizations in the same field become well defined and mature, or influenced to become homogeneous in an effort to appear legitimate to the audience 


How does it affect diversity in organizational populations?

- all organizations strive to operate as similarly to the most senior and successful firms
- since organizations serve an audience from whom they acquire the resources to survive, those that belong to a relatively smaller audience will be served less well than those who belong to the largest audience
