- Understanding the limits of organization and environment relations

- Current research may under estimate the power of traditional adaptation-based explanations

- Institutionalism views organizations as captives of the institutional environment in which they exist – focusing on organizational conformity with social rules and rituals

    - Conformity the driving force of organizational change – the tendency towards isomorphism

- Study private liberal arts colleges with strong pressures to conform

- New institutionalism

    - When organizations become well defined and mature, they influence other organizations in the same field to become homogenous as they strive for legitimacy

    - Conform to the mandate of the institutional environment

    - Older theories contradict this (adaptive theory) which sees organizations as continually adapting and changing

    - Neoinstitutionalists view changing technical environmental factors (consumer preference) as relatively unimportant sources of organizational change in *mature* organizational fields

    - Change is explained by organizations increasing resemblance to the most prestigious organizations in their field

    - In highly institutionalised organizational fields organizations that change in institutionally illegitimate ways typically suffer harmful performance consequences

    - Technical environmental factors are strong predictors of adoption for earlier adopters of organizational innovations not for later adopters

- Study educational institutes as they are judged more strongly by their appropriateness of their form than by their outputs & survival requires conforming

    - They operate in a highly structured (mature) organizational field

    - They resemble each other closely

    - Strong institutionalized pressures to exhibit **inertia, stability, persistence and conformity**

- The changing needs of students makes school a good area to study technical environmental factors – change towards professional programs rather than a liberal general knowledge education

- Well – defined highly structured organizational field that faces very strong institutional pressures and increasingly strong technical pressures

- Results – technical environments appeared to cause educational organizations to make significant legitimacy decreasing changes – a significant increase in heterogeneity ( not isomorphism)

    - Technical factors significantly predicted change & often had positive consequences

- When technical factors are strong – institutional theory may not work

- Organizational innovations may diffuse by beginning with a period of emer- gence, followed by divergence
