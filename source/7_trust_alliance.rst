Preface
-------

- examines how uncertainty moderates trust-performance relatinoships in alliances
- distinction betwen behavioural uncertainty and externally caused environmental uncertainty    
- argue that trust matters more to performance under behaviouraluncertainty and less under environmental uncertainty
- conclude that partners should concentrate on developing interorganizational trust where potential improvement in alliance performance justifies this effort, which depends on the type of uncertainty faced


Introduction
------------

- alliances blur firm boundaries and create mutual dependence between previously independent firms

- partners have to deal with:

    - the uncertainty of their environment
    - the uncertainty of each other's behaviour

- relational factors are important for smooth functioning of strategic alliances
    
    - e.g. solidarity, flexibility
    - trust has received the most attention, and has been identified as a key factor contributing to alliance success: trust has a positive effect on alliance performance


- intentionally cultivating trust implies a substantial opportunity cost in its pursuit
- trust does not always improve alliance performance
- relationship between trust and aliiance performance may be complicated and contingent on other factors

- trust brings about benefit:

    - brings good faith in the intent, reliability, and fairness of partner behaviour
    - allows for constructive interpretation of partner motives
    - reduces potential for conflict
    - encourages smooth information flow between partners

- same qualities of trust that mitigate uncertainty about partner behaviour and engender its beneficial effects may also limit the cognitiive efforts of partners when they consider their broader environment

    - percetption of reliability ofinformation from a partner and the cofnitive comfort that trust brings limits the variety of thought and action and attentiveness to detail

    - may reduce the alterness needed when alliance partners have to respond to environmental uncertainty

Trust and Alliance Performance
------------------------------

- **interorganizational trust**, the expectation held by one firm that another will not exploit its vulnerabilities when faced with the oppportunity to do so

    - trust is confirmed when:

        - parties demonstrate **reliability** by carrying out promises
        - act **fairly** when dealing with each other
        - exhibit **goodwill** when unforeseen contingencies arise

            - goodwill extends beyond contractual obligations
            - partners make contributions to relationship that go beyond what was explicitly guaranteed

- conflict between partners of an alliance can induce high costs or a premature breakdown of relationships

    - trust helps defuse such conflict, because partners are more likely to interpret each other's actions in a manner conductive to the stability of the relationship
    - if a firm encounters unexpected actions by its partner that could be ascribed to both good and bad intentions, the presence of trust reduces the likelyhood of a negative interpretation
    - e.g. selling partner's disappointing sales of another partner's product line, product partner could think:
        
        - ineffective promotional compaign
        - failure signals a lack of commitment of the selling partner's distributors

        - trust facilitates mutual understanding and allows for the benefit of the doubt
        - reduces the costs of interpartner conflict as well as other transaction costs

Trust, Behavioural Uncertainty, and Alliance Performance
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

- concern about partner behaviour is a predominant source of internal tension in strategic alliances
- the potential inherent in a situation for difficulty in anticipating and understanding actions stem in large part from **behavioural uncertainty**

- potential inability to anticipate and understand actions in higher in alliances that:

    - involve high **interdependence**: where partner contributions that are highly intertwined

        - increases with the importance and extent of the reosurces shared between partners and with the resulting overlap in division of labour between them (i.e. resulting in shared responsibility for a number of tasks)

            - sharing production facilities only creates weak interdependence
            - developing new technologies or speeding up innovation leads to high interdependence

        - if high interdependence:
        
            - coordination is difficult because of the complexity associated with interdependence discourages coordination by standardization
            - any change one partner makes will affect the other partner in unplanned ways, and the more immediate and severe the adverse impact of any mistake by a partner will be
            
            - requires partners to share valuable knowledge-intensive resources
            
                - increases the potential for misunderstandings concerning partner interrests and alliance contribution since shared-knowledge intensive reousrces are harder to observe, value, and protect

        - interorganizational trust is especially beneficial in the presence of behavioural uncertainty
            
            - asserting good faith in the intent and reliability of partner behaviours allows partners to engage in constructive interpretations of each other's actions
            - encourages partners to be aware of the processes and procedures that each partner follows
            - encourages partners to remain flexible when managing their interface in the face of interdependence
            - allievates apprehensions regarding the sharing of valuable information; resulting in information exchange and assitance in maintaining effective integration and coordination

        - under high interdependence, interorganizational trust is essential for alliance performance, as it faciliates mutual adjustment and allows teh smoother synchronization of critical tasks
        - the positive relation between trust and alliance performance is stronger in alliances with a high degree of interdependence than in alliances with low interdependence

    - have high **interpartner competition**: where partners are able to further private interests at the expense of collaborative interests or the other partner, esp. between competitors

        - concerns about opprtunistic exploitation loom large because partners may have strong incentives to appropriate each other's respources
        - because potential competitors are famililar with the areas that their partners operate in, they have superior capacity to absorb and reuse proprietary knowledge
        - trust can counteract such problmes by increasing each partner's confidence that the other will not abuse its vulnerabilities
        
            - faith in the intensions and fairness of the other makes each partner more likely to respect the boundaries of the other's resources and proprietary knowledge
        
        - the positive relation between trust and alliance is stronger in alliances with the potential for interpartner competition is higher than in alliances in which such potential is low

Trust, Environmental Uncertainty, and Alliance Performance
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

- e.g. instability or unpredictabiliity in markets
- demands speedy an dresponsive decisions
- requires organizations to engage in significant scanning of their environment in search of accurate and reliable information that enables them to interpret and act upon the threats and opportunities facing them

    - unpredictable changes in the environment stand to change the performance of an alliance
    - information processessing may be a bottleneck because of problems of information overload, which are exacerbated by information unfamiliarity
    - cognitive limitations may introduce considerable limitations and biases in the decision-making process, by prompting the appliaction of innappropriate rules-of-thumb

- the risk that biases will enter decision making in uncertain environments is greater in the presence of trust, esp. in alliances

    - trust enables decision making under the conditions of uncertaintiy, but may also produce systematic biases that can result in significant errors
    - when partners trust eachother, their tendency to screen th einformation provided by the other for accuracy decreases, and their inclanation to accept information at face value increases
    
- trusting alliance partners may even experience **strategic blindness**, outright insensitivity to environmental changes

    - because partners commit resources, effort, and time in the process of vultivating trust, they tend to be wary of actions that may damage the relationship
    - if responding to environmental change would require major changes, partners may be apprehensive about the eventuality of having to cultivate trust and adjust to a new partner all over again, or having to go it alone

- interorganizational trust stands to result in inadequate response to challenges posed by an uncertain environment becuase it limits cognitive efforts or causes strategic blindness

    - the positive effect of interorganizational trust is on alliance performance is weaker when market instability is high than low
    - the positive effect of interorganizational trust on alliance performance is weaker when market unpredictabiliity is high than when it is low

------------

- how trust, leading to the conservation of cognitive effort, is good

    - improve knowldge disclosure
    - acknowledge lack of knowledge
    - improves cooperation

- how trust, leading to the conservation of cognitive effort, is bad

    - reduces knowledge screening
    - sub-optimal use of source's knowledge
    - can lead to inertia, rigidities

- behavioural uncertainty
    
    - unexpected changes in behaviour
    - opportunity for competition
